### New Developer Test: Wish List For Santa

This project was done as a technical assessment with the requirements and guidelines below.

## Requirements


  * Items may not be blank strings nor duplicates of an item already on the list.
  * Clicking on an item in the list should remove it from the list.
  * Clicking the submit button should clear the wish list and create an alert that says 'Wish list submitted to Santa!'
  * User cannot submit if their wish list is empty.

  <br/>  

  * Please complete the Redux reducer in redux > reducer.jsx.  (Adding and deleting items from the list should be handled by Redux.)  Do not add any new actions, as this is a part of the challenge.
  * Everything else regarding Redux has been done for you (i.e. store, actions, etc.) and can be found in the "redux" folder

  <br/>

  * Please give a reasonable effort to closely match the styling in the demo.  This task is meant to test your ability to create accurate, responsive components.  As a head start, the inner container's dimensions are 400px x 540px.  You do not need to worry about the font-family.


## Guidelines
  * Aside from styling and reducer.jsx, all code should be written inside of App.jsx.
  * React hooks are preferred to class components if you are comfortable with them.  If not, that is okay, too.
  * Use of Styled-Components is preferred, though you may use any other styling libraries (or none) that you are more comfortable with.

  <br/>

  * Make sure to write code that you would be comfortable contributing in a professional setting.  Cleanliness and maintainability are just as important as making sure that it actually works.
  * In total, this assignment shouldn't take more than an hour or two to complete.  It's just a quick way to get a better feel for where you are at, so don't spend your entire day on it.
  * If you get stuck, feel free to leave comments in the code explaining how you would go about completing that part instead.
